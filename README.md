Hello, I am Rania Shaikh. A Data Analyst, with responsibilities that closely align with a Data Engineer role.
My day-to-day task involves:  
- Designing and performing ETL pipelines
- Running bash scripts
- Querying data using SQL.
- Generate reports and perform ad-hoc data analysis using SQL.
- Developing dashboards on Power-bi and Looker Studio.
